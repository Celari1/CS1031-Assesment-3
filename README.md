Why I designed it like this:

- I designed it using a bright theme to have it be eye catching and look bright, fresh and clean.
- I used bright colours on the navigation bar for the links to keep the page eye-catching and I show what page you are on using the active tag and a different colour.
- I chose the layout to try keep the webpages compact and not have the user scrolling through all the information to find anything.
- When picking colours I tried to stick to colours close to it to keep the design similar and not too jarring for the user while also being bright and eye-catching.

What challenges I faces:

- One of the biggest issues I faced was trying to make my collapse on the visit page into an accordian as I couldnt get it to work with the buttons and the text seperate using bootstrap. To fix this issue I used a normal collapse then added some Javascript to achieve the effect I was after and let the user view only one at once. 
- I also had issues with having images on my index page to not have a border around them and I solved this by setting them as background images to the area instead
