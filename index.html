            <div class="IndexFact1"><p>The town's name, Dunblane, is derived from the word 'dun' which means fortified hill and the word 'Blane' who was a St who came to the town in the 7th century. Dunblane can claim a city status from its large cathedral, but in reality it is still very much a town.</p></div>
