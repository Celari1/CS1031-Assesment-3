                <h2><u>The Romans</u></h2>
                <p>In the 6th century a Roman army had trooped through the Dunbane Parish. They left behind the reminants of 3 camps. They also left a signal station, a small fort and traces of their path north. Following this path north you will find one of the best preserved Roman forts in the United Kingdom, Where you can still view their massive defences.</p>

                <h2><u>The Foundation of Dunblane</u></h2>
                <p>Within Scotland, Dunblane is among the oldest of settlements. The town got its name from St Blane during the late 6th and 7th century. St Blane's exact relationship with the town is unclear, Although from the first written recording of the town, which was during the 10th century, it is refered to as Dulblaan or Blane's meadow. Some question if the Laighhills Park which is located along the river Allen on the edge of town could be the meadow reffered to.</p>

                <h2><u>Dunblane Cathedral</u></h2>
                <p>The Cathedral has been built on the site of a much earlier building which may have been constructed as early as the 9th century. You can still see parts of the earlier building in the first four storeys of the tower in the Cathedral, It has been built in Romanesque style and is estimated to have been built in around 1150 although some believe it was built much earlier in 1070. This makes it one of Scotlandâ€™s oldest buildings.</p>

                <p>The current Cathedral was constructed in the 13th century by two Bishops. Bishop Clement started the build during 1232-1258 and was finalised by Bisop Robert de Prebenda during 1258-1284. The two Bishops built it all in the same style and now is an attractive sight. Although during its early years after being built the Cathedral was much more adorned with bejewelled alters and many colourful paintings were hung around the walls.</p>

                <p>In around 1600 the roof of the nve ended up collapsing and was left a ruin for many years, until early 1890's when a highly successful restoration took place. This was funded almost entirely by Janet Wallace of Glassingall, and supervised by the architect Sir Rowand Anderson who managed to restore the Cathedral without losing any mediaeval character. The building is currently still in use for congregations and is open daily to visit.</p>

                <h2><u>A Stroll through the Old Town of Dunblane</u></h2>
                <p>There are many nice sites to see throughout Dunblane with the mixture of 18th century, Victorian and contemporary buildings. The Old Town is along the Old Great North Road from Bridgend, to the High Street, round the Cathedral, up the Braeport and through Ramoyle. The armies of William the Conqueror and Edward 1st, lead by Edward II came along this road to strip the lead off the roof of the Cathedral to aid them in their battle of Stirling Castle and Bannockburn</p>

                <p>There are many sites to see across this route such as: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The yellow stone work and the single arch of the original bridge which was built in 1410 by Bishop FInlay Dermoch</li>
                    <li>The Leighton Library which is open to the public during the summer and was built in the late 1680's to house the library of Bishop Robert Leighton, which he gave to Dunblane along with payment to built the library</li>
                    <li>On the corner facing the Cathedral you can find the Dean's House with some of the building dating in the early 17th century. The house currently holds the Dunblane Museum which has just been revamped and modernised</li>
                    <li>On Braeport you will find the old Victorian school, which is now known as the Braeport Centre. The building has 3 large classrooms where the teachers would struggled with their classes of up to 90 pupils in each.</li>
                    <li>Up on Ramoyle, which during the 19th century was home to many artisans(especially weavers). Many of the houses still show their origins</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><u>The Battle of Sheriffmuir</u></h2>
                <p>The Battle of Sheriffmuir took place on the 13th of November 1715. It was held three miles north east of Dunblane and directly south of the Sheriffmuir Inn. You can go see the site of the battle either on foot or by car. The pinnacle of the Jacobite Rebellion in 1715 was this battle. The Jacobite army consisted of 8,000 men who were lead by the Earl of Mar charged on the Redcoat army which only had numbers of 2,500. The Highlanders managed to defeat the Redcoats on their right but the left posed a further challenge. The Jacobites were untimately defeated by the Government Army. The Jacobites ended up retreating to Perth and soon disbanded their army.</p>

                <h2><u>Bonnie Prince Charlie</u></h2>
                <p>On the 11th of September 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed at Balhaldie House in Dunblane while travelling south with his Highland army. This house is located next door to the Library. Whilst staying there he was the guest of Alexander Drummond of Balhaldie, The Grand Old Man of Jacobitism in Dunblane.He had fought in many battles such as; The Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, The Edinburgh Castle seize in 1715 andd the Battle of Sheriffmuir. Somehow he was never arrested for these battles or had any of his estate taken</p>

                <p>Six months after the Prince's stay the Duke of Cumberland also stayed a night in Dunblane while he was chasing the Prince and his army. A servant girl from Balhaldie House had taken a fancy to the prince when he stayed and so when she spotted the Duke riding past the Leighton Library the next morning she threw a bucket of boiling oil over the Duke from an upper window of the house. He ended up getting thrown from his horse but suffered no other injuries. She was never caught and she most likely escaped using the Minnie Burn as is runs underground through the centre of Dunblane.</p>
